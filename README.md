# Purchase-Card-Transactions-in-Birmingham-City-Council

As part of transparent governance, many city councils have begun to publish transaction data. This practice is intended to ensure that resources are being used efficiently.  However, in many cases the data for monitoring is available, but because there is a lot of data it is difficult to validate that the management is being carried out correctly. Therefore, we will work with the assumption of a client, for example, an auditor who wants to analyze the dataset and detect that there is no overspending and is working with austerity policies.

This report describes a methodology that will allow an auditor to detect anomalies on the transactions of purchases with the city council cards, with aim of detecting suspicious behavior in transactions. A data-driven approach based on two methodologies for anomalies detection was used in the practice. This is a study case with data from Birmingham City Council.
